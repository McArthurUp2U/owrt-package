Subject: [PATCH 33/67] DOC: remove old tunnel mode assumptions
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

MichaÅ Pasierb reported doc inconsistencies regarding the old default
HTTP tunnel mode.

This patch fixes a few of those inconsistencies and should be backported
to both 1.6 and 1.5.
(cherry picked from commit f01a9cde382aa63423072b2666341aff8d7370ed)
