Subject: [PATCH 04/19] BUILD: freebsd: double declaration

On freebsd, the macro LIST_PREV already exists in the header file
<sys/queue.h>, and this makes a build error.

This patch removes the macros before declaring it. This ensure
that the error doesn't occurs.
(cherry picked from commit 1db96672c4cd264ebca8197bec93a5ce1b23aaa9)
